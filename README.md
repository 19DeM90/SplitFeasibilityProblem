# SplitFeasibilityProblem
This repository contains the Matlab code used in our paper "Inducing strong convergence into the asymptotic behaviour of proximal splitting algorithms in Hilbert spaces", appeared in Optimization Methods and Software 34(3), 489-514, 2019. 
We investigated a new algorithm for the solving of so-called monotone inclusions and applied it to the split feasibility problem
